# Portfolio
Git Repository for Jupyer Notebooks

In these Repo, I will share some projects related to Big Data analytics and (later on) machine learning. So every interested person can investigate and collaborate my stuff.

## Project 1 - [Big Data Analytics Thesis](https://github.com/RumbleBeee/Workexamples/tree/main/de/BigDataAnalytics)

As final thesis our goal was to prepare and analyze a given dataset and inspect these data for insights.
The given dataset was a modified version of [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kiva/data-science-for-good-kiva-crowdfunding) found at kaggle.com

The main tasks during the thesis where defined as follows:
 - [preprocessing](/de/BigDataAnalytics/BDA_Abschlussprojekt_Preprocessing.md)
 - data visualisation
 - documentation
 - presentation

### Info - 06.06.2022
At the moment, I uploaded only the preproccessing file cause there are some formatting problems with the presentation of the diagrams, I created during the exam. After fixing these issues, I will upload the data visualisation.
