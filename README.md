# Portfolio
Git Repository for Jupyer Notebooks

In these Repo, I will share some projects related to Big Data analytics and (later on) machine learning. So every interested person can investigate and collaborate my stuff.

## Project 1 - [Big Data Analytics Thesis](/BigData/Exam)

As final thesis our goal was to prepare and analyze a given dataset and inspect these data for insights.
The given dataset was a modified version of [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kiva/data-science-for-good-kiva-crowdfunding) found at kaggle.com

The main tasks during the thesis where defined as follows:
 - [preprocessing](/BigData/Exam/BDA_Abschlussprojekt_Preprocessing.md)
 - [data visualisation](https://nbviewer.org/github/RumbleBeee/Portfolio/blob/master/BigData/Exam/BDA_Abschlussprojekt_EDA.ipynb)
 - documentation
 - presentation
